    <section id="aluminum">
        <h2>6.1 Aluminum (Al)</h2>
        <p>It is the richest mineral in the earth's crust. It does not appear in its pure form.</p>
        
        <h4>Manufacture</h4>
        <p>Aluminum is derived from bauxite, a mineral mined from the earth. Two to three tonnes of bauxite are required to produce one tonne of alumina and two tonnes of alumina are required to produce one tonne of aluminium metal. The aluminium industry relies on the Bayer's process to produce alumina from bauxite.</p>

    <section id="copper">
        <h2>6.2 Copper (Cu)</h2>
        <p>The symbol for copper is Cu and comes from the Latin cuprum meaning from the island of Cyprus. It is an important engineering metal with wide applications. It is one of the most principal metals used to produce widely applied, significant engineering alloy's brass and bronze.</p>

        <h4>Manufacture</h4>
        <p>Copper is extracted from various ores. Generally it is recovered from sulphide ores by a dry extraction process in which the powdered and concentrated ore is roasted where necessary to drive off excess sulphur and smelted in a furnace to produce copper matte.</p>
        

        <h4>Salient Characteristics</h4>
        <ul class="char-list">
            <li><b>Appearance:</b> Copper is red in color when polished, and oxidizes to various shades of green.</li>
            <li><b>Strength-to-Weight Ratio:</b> Copper and its alloys have relatively low strength-to-weight ratios and low strengths at elevated temperatures. Some copper alloys are also susceptible to stress-corrosion cracking unless they are stress relieved.</li>
            <li><b>Capability:</b> Copper can be forged and cold worked. Pure copper is not suitable for welding. It has poor foundry properties due to large shrinkage.</li>
            <li><b>Machinability:</b> Copper is very ductile and malleable metal. Its machinability is only fair i.e. very difficult to machine due to its high ductility.</li>
            <li><b>Hot Short:</b> Some of the copper alloys are hot short; they become brittle at high temperatures, because some of the alloying elements form oxides and other compounds at the grain boundaries, embrittling the material.</li>
            <li><b>Strength:</b> Copper alloys derive their strength from cold working.</li>
            <li><b>Thermal Conductor:</b> Copper has excellent thermal conductivity among all commercial metals due to which it conducts heat rapidly.</li>
            <li><b>Electrical Conductor:</b> Copper has good electrical conductivity among the commercial metals.</li>
            <li><b>Corrosion resistance:</b> Copper has good resistance to corrosion under ordinary atmospheric conditions, in fresh and sea water which makes it very useful in the process industries.</li>
            <li><b>Nonmagnetic:</b> Pure copper is nonmagnetic.</li>
            <li><b>Sparks:</b> Copper gives off no sparks.</li>
            <li><b>Fracture:</b> Copper presents a smooth surface when fractured, which is free from crystalline appearance.</li>
            <li><b>Torch test:</b> Because copper conducts heat rapidly, a larger flame is required to produce fusion of copper than is needed for the same size piece of steel. Copper melts suddenly and solidifies instantly.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Important Engineering Applications</h4>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>The main use of pure copper is in the electrical industry due its excellent thermal conductivity and ductile in nature where it is made into wire or other conductors.</li>
