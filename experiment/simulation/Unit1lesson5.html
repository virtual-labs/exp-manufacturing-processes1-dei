    <section id="aluminum">
        <h2>6.1 Aluminum (Al)</h2>
        <p>It is the richest mineral in the earth's crust. It does not appear in its pure form.</p>
        
        <h4>Manufacture</h4>
        <p>Aluminum is derived from bauxite, a mineral mined from the earth. Two to three tonnes of bauxite are required to produce one tonne of alumina and two tonnes of alumina are required to produce one tonne of aluminium metal. The aluminium industry relies on the Bayer's process to produce alumina from bauxite.</p>
        
        

        <h4>Salient Characteristics</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Appearance</b>: Aluminum is light gray to silver in color, very bright when polished, dull when oxidized, and light in weight.</li>
            <li><b>Strength-to-Weight Ratio</b>: Aluminum exhibits high strength-to-weight ratio i.e. it offers a unique combination of lightweight and high strength.</li>
            <li><b>Capability</b>: It has a capability of being cast, forged, machined, formed, and welded. Aluminum sections can be joined by the use of adhesives, clips, bolts, rivets.</li>
            <li><b>Lightweight</b>: Aluminum weighs less by volume than most other metals. It is about one-third the weight of iron, steel, copper, or brass.</li>
            <li><b>Excellent Thermal Conductor</b>: It conducts heat better than other common metals.</li>
            <li><b>Strong</b>: As temperatures fall, aluminum becomes stronger. Therefore, Cold-weather applications are particularly well served by aluminum.</li>
            <li><b>Conducts Electricity</b>: Electrical conductivity of aluminum is twice as copper.</li>
            <li><b>Nonmagnetic</b>: Aluminum is non-magnetic in nature, therefore, it is useful for high-voltage applications, as well as for electronics, especially where magnetic fields come into play or where magnetic devices are employed.</li>
            <li><b>Resilient</b>: Aluminum combines strength with flexibility and can flex under loads or spring back from the shock of impact.</li>
            <li><b>Reflective</b>: Highly reflective aluminum can be used to shield products or areas from light, radio waves, or infrared radiation.</li>
            <li><b>Not Combustible</b>: Aluminum does not burn and, even at extremely high temperatures, does not produce toxic fumes.</li>
            <li><b>Accepts a Variety of Common Finishes</b>: Aluminum can be finished with liquid paint, powder coatings, anodizing, or electroplating.</li>
            <li><b>Sparks</b>: No sparks are given off from aluminum. It is appropriate for applications taking place in highly flammable environments or involving explosive materials. Aluminum does not turn red before melting.</li>
            <li><b>Resists Corrosion</b>: Aluminum offers excellent corrosion resistance; it does not rust. Its own naturally occurring oxide film protects aluminum.</li>
            <li><b>Fracture</b>: A fracture in rolled aluminum sections shows a smooth, bright structure and fracture in an aluminum casting shins a bright crystalline structure.</li>
            <li><b>Spark test</b>: No sparks are given off from aluminum.</li>
            <li><b>Torch test</b>: Aluminum does not turn red before melting. It holds its shape until almost molten, then collapses (hot shorts) suddenly. A heavy film of white oxide forms instantly on the molten surface.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Important Engineering Applications:</h4>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Aluminum is used as a de-oxidizer and alloying agent in the manufacture of steel.</li>

    <section id="copper">
        <h2>6.2 Copper (Cu)</h2>
        <p>The symbol for copper is Cu and comes from the Latin cuprum meaning from the island of Cyprus. It is an important engineering metal with wide applications. It is one of the most principal metals used to produce widely applied, significant engineering alloy's brass and bronze.</p>

        <h4>Manufacture</h4>
        <p>Copper is extracted from various ores. Generally it is recovered from sulphide ores by a dry extraction process in which the powdered and concentrated ore is roasted where necessary to drive off excess sulphur and smelted in a furnace to produce copper matte.</p>
        
        

        <h4>Salient Characteristics</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Appearance</b>: Copper is red in color when polished, and oxidizes to various shades of green.</li>
            <li><b>Strength-to-Weight Ratio</b>: Copper and its alloys have relatively low strength-to-weight ratios and low strengths at elevated temperatures. Some copper alloys are also susceptible to stress-corrosion cracking unless they are stress relieved.</li>
            <li><b>Capability</b>: Copper can be forged and cold worked. Pure copper is not suitable for welding. It has poor foundry properties due to large shrinkage.</li>
            <li><b>Machinability</b>: Copper is very ductile and malleable metal. Its machinability is only fair i.e. very difficult to machine due to its high ductility.</li>
            <li><b>Hot Short</b>: Some of the copper alloys are hot short; they become brittle at high temperatures, because some of the alloying elements form oxides and other compounds at the grain boundaries, embrittling the material.</li>
            <li><b>Strength</b> Copper alloys derive their strength from cold working.</li>
            <li><b>Thermal Conductor</b>: Copper has excellent thermal conductivity among all commercial metals due to which it conducts heat rapidly.</li>
            <li><b>Electrical Conductor</b>: Copper has good electrical conductivity among the commercial metals.</li>
            <li><b>Corrosion resistance</b>: Copper has good resistance to corrosion under ordinary atmospheric conditions, in fresh and sea water which makes it very useful in the process industries.</li>
            <li><b>Nonmagnetic</b>: Pure copper is nonmagnetic.</li>
            <li><b>Sparks</b>: Copper gives off no sparks.</li>
            <li><b>Fracture</b>: Copper presents a smooth surface when fractured, which is free from crystalline appearance.</li>
            <li>Copper melts suddenly and solidifies instantly.</li>
            <li><b>Torch test</b>: Because copper conducts heat rapidly, a larger flame is required to produce fusion of copper than is needed for the same size piece of steel. Copper melts suddenly and solidifies instantly.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Important Engineering Applications</h4>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>The main use of pure copper is in the electrical industry due its excellent thermal conductivity and ductile in nature where it is made into wire or other conductors.</li>
            <li>It is used in the manufacture of nonferrous alloys such as brass, bronze, and Monel metal.</li>
            <li>Typical copper products are sheet roofing, cartridge cases, springs, heat exchangers, bushings, wire, bearings, statues, decorative objects.</li>

    <section id="lead">
        <h2>6.3 Lead (Pb)</h2>
        <p>The symbol for lead is Pb and comes after the plumbum, the root for the word plumber. Lead was probably one of the first metals to be produced by man. It falls in the category of low melting alloys due to its relatively low melting point. Lead is not found free in nature but it is obtained from Galena (lead sulphide).</p>

        <h4>Manufacture</h4>
        <p>The important lead minerals are galena (PbS), anglesite (PbSO<sub>4</sub>) and cerussite (PbCO<sub>3</sub>), respectively with 86%, 68% and 77% of lead. Generally lead is extracted from galena (lead sulphide). During extraction of lead initially different ores are separated using selective froth flotation technique.</p>

        <h4>Salient Characteristics</h4>
        <p>Lead is unique among common metals. It has little mechanical strength, virtually no elasticity and is extremely soft.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>General</b>: Lead is a heavy, soft, malleable metal with low melting point, low tensile strength, and low creep strength.</li>
            <li><b>Capabilities</b>: Lead can be cast, cold worked, welded, and machined.</li>
            <li><b>Corrosion resistant</b>: It is resistant to corrosion, atmosphere, moisture, water, and to many acids.</li>
            <li><b>Strong</b>: Lead has low strength with heavy weight.</li>
            <li><b>Harmful</b>: Lead dust and fumes are very poisonous.</li>
            <li><b>Appearance</b>: Lead is a bluish-white lustrous metal.</li>
            <li><b>Electrical conductor</b>: Relatively poor conductor of electricity.</li>
            <li>The addition of a small percentage of arsenic, or antimony, to the lead, increases its hardness and mechanical resistance, protecting it from abrasion.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Important Engineering Applications:</h4>
        <p>Lead alloys are largely used in industry.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Lead-acid battery</b>: Biggest use of lead worldwide is for the lead-acid battery. The lead-acid battery consists of lead alloy pasted grids. The grids are made from a lead-antimony alloy (commonly containing from 0.75 - 5% antimony) together with minor additions of other elements.</li>
            <li><b>Cable sheathing</b> Because of it's excellent proven corrosion resistance when in contact with a wide range of industrial and marine environments, soils and chemicals, lead is used to provide a sheath on electric cables. And also provide insulation surrounding the conductors to protect users.</li>
            <li><b>Building Construction</b>: Lead is used in building construction in both pipe and sheet form. Due to lead's corrosion resistant properties. Lead pipe are used for carriage of corrosive chemicals at chemical plants.</li>
            <li><b>Chemical Compounds</b>: Many types of chemical compounds are produced from lead; among these are lead carbonate (paint pigment) and tetraethyl lead (antiknock gasoline).</li>
            <li><b>Radiation Shields</b>: Lead is also used for X-ray protection. Lead pipes have not been used in new domestic water supplies for about 30 years. However.</li>
            <li><b>Lead compounds</b> Tetraethyl and tetramethyl lead (TEL and TML) are used as anti-knock additives in petrol as the most economic method of raising the "octane rating" to provide the grade of petrol needed for the efficient operation of internal combustion engines of high compression ratio.</li>

    <section id="cobalt">
        <h2>6.4 Cobalt (Co)</h2>
        <p>The metallic element cobalt is one of the transition elements, closely related to iron and nickel. These three elements are sometimes referred to as the iron family. Cobalt was identified and described in 1735 by Swedish chemist Georg Brandt. The symbol for cobalt is Co.</p>

        <h4>Manufacture</h4>
        <p>Cobalt does not occur in the free state but is combined with such elements as copper, arsenic, sulfur, and oxygen in mineral ores. The principal minerals are smaltite a compound of cobalt and arsenic and cobaltite (a compound of cobalt, arsenic, and sulfur). One method of ore extraction consists of a series of steps that include smelting and roasting, leaching, precipitation, and electrolysis. In a related method, a cobalt precipitate is reduced by heating it in the presence of aluminum, carbon, or hydrogen.</p>

        <h4>Salient Characteristics</h4>
        <p>It is hard but chemically less reactive than iron. At ordinary temperatures cobalt is unaffected by air or water. It dissolves slowly in dilute acids, releasing hydrogen gas.<br>
        <b>General</b>: Cobalt is a hard and easily magnetizable, white metal similar to nickel in appearance, but has a slightly bluish cast.<br>
        <b>Capabilities</b>: Cobalt can be welded, machined (limited), and cold-drawn.<br>
        <b>Limitations</b>: Welding high carbon cobalt steel often causes cracking. Cobalt must be machined with cemented carbide cutters.<br>
        <b>Cobalt alloy is heat and corrosion resistant</b>.<br>
        <b>Appearance</b>: Pure cobalt is silvery white with a reddish tone.</p>

        <h4>Important Engineering Applications</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Cobalt is used chiefly in alloy steels for making high-speed, high-temperature, creep-resisting metal-cutting tools and cemented carbide tools, bits, and cutters.</li>
            <li>Cobalt is also used to make permanent magnets for loudspeakers.</li>
            <li>Cobalt is used as a catalyst in such processes as the synthesis of gasoline.</li>

        <div class="qa-block">
            <p><b>Chromium</b> is used as an alloying element in carbon steels to increase hardenability, corrosion resistance, and shock resistance. It imparts high strength with little loss in ductility.</p>
            <p><b>Nickel</b> increases the toughness, strength, and ductility of steels, and lowers the hardening temperatures.</p>
            <p><b>Manganese</b> is used in steel to produce greater toughness, wear resistance, easier hot rolling, and forging. An increase in manganese content decreases the weldability of steel.</p>
            <p><b>Molybdenum</b> increases hardenability. The impact fatigue property of the steel is improved with up to 0.60 percent molybdenum.</p>
            <p><b>Titanium</b> used as additional alloying agents in low-carbon content, corrosion resistant steels. Supports resistance to intergranular corrosion after the metal is subjected to high temperatures for a prolonged time period.</p>
            <p><b>Tungsten</b>, as an alloying element in tool steel that retains its hardness at high temperatures.</p>
            <p><b>Vanadium</b> is used to help control grain size. It is also added to steel during manufacture to remove oxygen.</p>
            <p><b>Silicon</b> is added to steel to obtain greater hardenability and corrosion resistance, and is often used with manganese to obtain strong and tough steel.</p>
