    <h2 id="introduction">2.0 Introduction</h2>
    <p>The importance of metals in modern technology is due, in large part, to the ease with which they may be formed, into useful shapes such as tubes, rods, and sheets.<br>
    Useful shapes may be generated in two basic ways:<br>
    1. By plastic deformation processes in which the volume and mass of metal are conserved and the metal is displaced from one location to another.<br>
    2. By metal removal or machining processes in which material is removed in order to give it the required shape.</p>
    <p>Forging is the working of metal into a useful shape by hammering or pressing. Various useful shapes are obtained by compressive forces that are applied on workpiece through various dies and tools. The compressive forces for forging are derived either from the impact of a hammer (hand or power operated) or from the pressure exerted by a large mechanical press. Metals in forging are deformed plastically at room temperature (cold forging) as well as at higher temperature (hot forging). The ability to cold forge the metal depends on the ductility and malleability of the metal whereas the ability to hot forge the metal depends on its 'range of plasticity' at higher temperature. The forged components are called forgings.</p>
    <p>Cold forging may generally cause anisotropy, a state in which properties of the metal are different in different directions and this effect of cold forging is taken care of by annealing the cold forged component.</p>
    <p>The forgeability of a metal is defined as the capability of the metal to undergo deformation without cracking. A commonly accepted test for forgeability is to upset a solid cylindrical specimen and observe any cracking on the barrelled surface, the greater the deformation prior to cracking, the greater the forgeability of metal.</p>
    <p>In forging metal may be:<br>
    1. drawn out to increase its length and decrease it cross-section.<br>
    2. upset to decrease the length and increase the cross-section.<br>
    3. squeezed in closed impression dies to produce the desired shape by compelling the metal flow in to multi-directions.</p>

    <h2 id="applications">2.1 Applications of Forging</h2>
    <p>The following common types of jobs are produced by forging:<br>
    (i) Box-end wrenches, always made from forgings, are subjected to very high stresses due to hammering; excellent for providing highest torque to tighten the bolts. Casting can not survive.<br>
    (ii) Riveting of shells for boilers, tanks and furnaces.<br>
    (iii) Machinery parts and steel furniture.<br>
    (iv) Bolts, headed pins, nuts, nails, keys, eye bolts, hooks, bolts, shakles, hinges, aldrops, hangers and racks, hooks, links and other lifting tackles for cranes and hoists.<br>
    (v) Arms, weapons and cutting tools.<br>
    (vi) Agricultural implements and tools.<br>
    (vii) Cams, crank shafts connecting rods, axles and levers, etc. for vehicles, locomotives and aircrafts.<br>
    (viii) Helical and laminated springs.<br>
    (ix) Landing gear cylinders, beams for aircraft wings, turbine disks, gears, wheels.</p>
    <p>Forging operations produces discrete parts while rolling operations, produce continuous plates, sheets, strip, or various structural cross-sections. Figure 1 shows typical products made from forging operations.</p>

    </div>

    <p>The first question that comes to us is why is it necessary to forge a part to shape when it is simpler and cheaper to cast or machine the metal direct to the form required? It is true that casting or machining process may be cheaper when compared to forging operations for certain products. If the function of a component calls for high strength and resistance to shock or vibration, the properties must be uniform, easily predicted, and measurable within close limits. To achieve this it is usually necessary for steel to be subjected to some form of hot working or forging into more complex shapes. Forging refines the grain structure and improves physical properties of the metal. In forging controlled development of grain flow lines which closely follow the outline of component is obtained (Figures 2, 3, 4 & 5). The continuous grain flow lines increase overall toughness of the forged part and decrease its susceptibility to fatigue and corrosion failures. Internal flaws of the metal are largely eliminated.</p>

    </div>

    <p><b>Advantages of forging</b><br>
    (i) Physical properties (such as strength, ductility and toughness) are much better in a forging than in the base metal, which has, crystals randomly oriented. Grains are refined and improved, (Figures 2, 3 & 4).<br>
    (ii) Forging produces beneficial grain-flow pattern in the direction of the shape of the forged component, resulting in tough fibrous structure conforming to the outline of the part, (Figures 2, 3 & 4).<br>
    (iii) Forging yields parts that have high strength to weight ratio, they can be used reliably for highly stressed and critical applications.<br>
    (iv) Forging produces products with higher structural integrity, which are consistent from piece to piece, without any porosity, voids, inclusions and other defects as in case of casting, (Figures 2, 3 & 4).<br>
    (v) Reduced testing requirements.</p>
    <p><b>Disadvantages of forging</b><br>
    (i) Hot metal oxidizes rapidly and the scale thus formed gives poor surface finish,<br>
    (ii) Close dimensional tolerances on forgings may not be maintained.<br>
    (iii) Metal has to be worked within a particular range of temperature: if worked below, it will crack or get distorted and if worked above the required temperature range, it may burn. Hence, too much care is needed while maintaining the optimum temperature for forging.</p>

    <h2 id="metals">2.2 Metals and their forging temperatures</h2>
    <p>The degree to which a metal can be forged depends on its composition and structure. The low and medium carbon steels are readily forged but high carbon and alloy steels are more difficult to forge. The metals and alloys that can be forged include carbon steels, alloy steels, stainless steels, wrought iron, copper base alloys, nickel and nickel-copper alloys, aluminum alloys and magnesium alloys. Cast iron is not forgeable because it has a crystalline structure and when heated and beaten, it breaks into pieces. Every metal has its own forging temperature range at which it goes in plastic state (see Table-1).</p>
    <p><center><b>Table 1: Forging temperatures of ferrous and non-ferrous metals</b></center></p>
    <table class="simple" style="width:60%; margin:auto;">
        <tr><th>Material to be forged</th><th>Temperature range(°C)</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Mild steel</td><td>815-1250</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Medium carbon steel</td><td>760-1250</td></tr>

        <tr><td>Magnesium alloys</td><td>315</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Wrought iron</td><td>860-1340</td></tr>
    </table>

    <h2 id="measurement">2.3 Measurement of Forging Temperatures</h2>
    <p>Thermocouples are used for measuring temperatures usually from 200 to 1300°C. Then there are optical pyrometers which are used for measuring temperatures in higher range, 700 to 2000°C. Radiation pyrometers are also available for measuring still higher temperatures.<br>
    The assessment of temperature of hot metals by seeing its colour is an approximate method of temperature measurement. In case of steels, the following information may be useful (Table-2).</p>

        <tr><td>Orange</td><td>900-1000</td></tr>
        <tr><td>White</td><td>1300-1500</td></tr>

    <h2 id="classification">2.4 Classification of Forging</h2>
    <p>Forging can be classified into two categories<br>
    1. Open die forging, and<br>
    2. Closed die forging</p>

    </div>

    <h3 id="opendie">2.4.1 Open Die Forging</h3>
    <p>It is the simplest forging process which is quite flexible but not suitable for large scale production. The operation is carried out between two flat dies or dies of very simple shape, figures 6a & 7. The process of open die forging is carried out in large hydraulic presses or power hammer. Since in open die forging the workpiece is usually larger than the tool, at any point of time, deformation is confined to a small portion of the workpiece. Numerous squeezes or blows are applied to different portions of the workpiece to bring it to the final desired shape. The operator obtains the desired shape of forging gradually and step by step, by manipulating the work material between blows. The resulting size and shape of the forging are dependent on the skill of the operator.</p>
    <p><b>Applications:</b> The process is mostly used for forging large objects of simple shape or when number of parts to be made is small. Open die forging is often used to make preforms (of workpiece) for use in close die forging and large and bulky forgings. Examples of parts made in open die forging include ship propeller shaft, rings, pressure vessels, gun tubes, ring forgings. The process can produce forgings up to 200 tons of weight.</p>

        <b>Figure 7: Open die forging (workpiece is held manually and manipulated manually to obtain desired shape).</b>
    </div>
    <p>The open die forging can be explained in the simplest way by the following two open die operations explained in next sections:<br>
    (a) Cogging or drawing out<br>
    (b) Upsetting</p>
    <p><b>Advantages of open die forging</b><br>
    (i) Simple process<br>
    (ii) Dies are inexpensive<br>
    (iii) Useful for small quantities<br>
    (iv) Wide range of job sizes can be handled</p>
    <p><b>Limitations of open die forging</b><br>
    (i) Limited to simple shapes<br>
    (ii) Close dimensional tolerances not possible<br>
    (iii) Machining to final shape required if necessary<br>
    (iv) Low production rate (v) High degree of skill required</p>
    <p><i>Forging Force</i><br>
    In open die forging operation, the forging force F, to be applied on a solid cylindrical component can be determined from the relation.</p>
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="images/mem/Unit2/Lesson3/F1.jpg" alt="">
    </div>
    <p>Where<br>
    σ<sub>f</sub> is the flow stress of the material, μ is the coefficient of friction, and d and h are the diameter and height of the work piece, respectively.</p>
    <p><b>Example</b>: Using open-die forging operation, a solid cylindrical piece of 304 stainless steel having 100 mm diameter x 72 mm height is reduced in the height to 60 mm at room temperature. Assuming the coefficient of friction as 0.22 and the flow stress for this material at the required true strain as 1000 MPa, calculate the forging force at the end of stroke.<br>
    <b>Solution:</b><br>
    Initial diameter = 100 mm<br>
    Initial height = 72 mm<br>
    Final height = 60 mm<br>
    If final diameter is d, (100)<sup>2</sup> x 72 = d<sup>2</sup> x 60, i.e. d =110 mm<br>

    <h3 id="closeddie">2.4.2 Closed Die Forging (Impression Die Forging)</h3>
    <p>In closed die forging the workpiece is deformed under high pressure between two die halves, which have the impressions of the desired final shape. The heated metal (billet) is positioned in the lower die cavity and on it one or more blows are struck by the upper die. This hammering makes the metal (billet) to flow and fill the die cavity completely. Excess metal is squeezed out around the periphery of the cavity to form flash. On completion of forging, the flash is trimmed off with the help of a trimming die. The work material is given final desired shape in stages as it is deformed in several successive die sets. Thus, a high precision forged with close dimensional tolerances is produced. Closed die forging is shown in Figures 8, 9 &10. The shape of the die cavities cause the metal to flow in desired direction, thereby imparting desired fibre structure to the component. This process is also known as impression die forging.</p>

    <h2 id="operations">2.5 Forging Operations</h2>
    <p>Most forgings are obtained in multiple steps with series of dies, where one or more blows of the hammer are used for each step in the sequence. The reason for multi steps is to distribute the metal roughly in accordance with the requirements of the later steps and smooth out the forging force requirement. These processes prepare the workpieces for further forging processes. Few of the forging operations are: Upsetting, Cogging, Edging, Fullering, Blocking and Finishing.</p>

    <h3>2.5.1 Upsetting</h3>
    <p>The simplest example of open die forging is the upsetting operation shown in Figure-12. In upsetting, a solid workpiece is placed between two flat dies and reduced in height (but increasing in size in lateral direction) by the application of compressive force. The die surfaces may be flat or having simple cavities to produce relatively simple forgings.</p>
    <p><b>Equipment</b>: Hydraulic, mechanical presses, screw presses; hammers, upsetting machines.<br>
    <b>Applications</b>: Finished forgings, including nuts, bolts; flanged shafts, preforms for finished forgings.</p>

        <b>Figure 12: Upsetting operation and barreling effect during upsetting</b>
    </div>
    <p>As the metal flows laterally between the advancing die surfaces, there is less deformation at the die interface because of the friction forces than at the mid-height plane resulting into the barreling of the sides of upset workpiece. Metal flows most easily towards the nearest free surface because that represents the lowest frictional path. Proper lubrication can help reduce the barreling effect. [Figures 12 & 13] (explained in next section).</p>

    <p><b>Evolution of bulge in hot upsetting</b><br>
    Successful upsetting mainly depends on two process limitations:<br>
    1. Upset strain, <span style="text-decoration:overline">ε</span> : that affects the forming limit or forgeability of the workpiece material,<br>
    <img src="images/mem/Unit2/Lesson3/F3.jpg" alt=""><br>
    2. Upset Ratio (R<sub>u</sub>): that affects the buckling of the workpiece<br>
    <img src="images/mem/Unit2/Lesson3/F4.jpg" alt=""><br>
    Where, h<sub>0</sub> is the original (before upset) height, h<sub>1</sub> is the final height (after upset) and d<sub>0</sub> is the original diameter of the billet.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> <i>In metal forming, the flow of metal is caused by the pressure transmitted from the dies to the deforming workpiece. Therefore, the frictional conditions at the die/workpiece interface greatly influence metal flow. Figure-18 above illustrates this phenomenon as it applies to the upsetting of a cylindrical workpiece. The figure 18 (a) shows, under frictionless conditions, the workpiece deforms uniformly and the resulting normal stress, σ<sub>n</sub>, is constant across the diameter. However, figure 18 (b) shows that under actual conditions, where some level of frictional stress, τ, is present, the deformation of the workpiece is not uniform (i.e. barreling). As a result, the normal stress, σ<sub>n</sub>, increases from the outer diameter to the center of the workpiece and the total upsetting force is greater than for the frictionless conditions.</i></p>
    <p><b>To prevent buckling the following rules must be followed in designing parts to be upset forged.</b><br>
    1. The length of the billet to be upset forged should not exceed three items the billet diameter.<br>
    2. Length of billet exceeding three times billet diameter may be upset successfully provided the diameter of cavity does not exceed 1 and half times the billet diameter.<br>
    3. In an upset requiring stock length exceeding three times billet diameter and where diameter of cavity is not exceeding 1 and half the billet diameter the length of unsupported metal beyond the face of the die must not exceed the diameter of the bar.</p>

    <h3>2.5.2 Cogging (drawing out)</h3>
    <p>Cogging is an open die forging operation in which the thickness of a bar (or workpiece) is reduced by successive hammer blows at specific intervals (as shown in Figures-19, 20, 21, 22 & 23). Typical examples of cogging operation are shown in figures 21, 22, & 23. Since the contact area per stroke is small, thickness of workpieces are reduced in stages.</p>

    <h3>2.5.3 Edging</h3>
    <p>Edging is the process of gathering material into a region using a concave shaped open die. The process is called edging because it is usually carried out on the ends of the workpiece (Figure-24).</p>

    <h3>2.5.4 Fullering</h3>
    <p>Fullering is the process of reducing the cross-sectional area of a portion of the stock using a convex shaped die. The metal flow is outward and away from the centre of the fuller (Figure-25).</p>

    <h3>2.5.5 Blocking</h3>
    <p>Blocking stage makes the metal to approximately final shape, with generous corner and fillet radii (Figure-26).</p>

    <h3>2.5.6 Finishing</h3>
    <p>Finisher die imparts final shape and size, after which the flash is trimmed from the part (Figure-26).</p>
