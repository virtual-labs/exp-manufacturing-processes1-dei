## 4.0 Introduction
Forging equipment is classified based on its principle of operation into two main categories:

* **Forging Hammers:** Energy-restricted machines. The force is supplied by a falling ram. Deformation results from dissipating the kinetic energy of the ram.
* **Forging Presses:**
    * *Mechanical Presses:* Stroke-restricted (defined by the path of the crank).
    * *Hydraulic Presses:* Load-restricted (defined by maximum pressure capacity).

## 4.1 Forging Hammers or Power Hammers
Hammers are the most versatile equipment for impact loading. They are characterized by multiple blows between contoured dies to achieve the final shape.

### 4.1.1 Gravity Drop Hammers
The ram is lifted to a specific height and dropped. During the downstroke, the ram is accelerated solely by gravity.



**Energy Calculation:**
The total blow energy is equal to the potential energy at the height of release:
$$E = mgh = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$

### 4.1.2 Power Drop Hammers
The ram is accelerated by steam or compressed air in addition to gravity during the downstroke. This allows for much higher impact speeds.



**Energy Calculation:**
$$E = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 + (p \cdot A + mg)H$$

*Where:*
- $p$ = Air/Steam pressure
- $A$ = Area of the piston
- $H$ = Stroke height

## 4.2 Forging Presses

### 4.2.1 Mechanical Presses
These machines use flywheels and crank/eccentric mechanisms to translate rotary motion into linear motion. They are best suited for high-volume production of low-profile parts.

### 4.2.2 Hydraulic Presses
Operated by hydraulic fluid moving a piston, these machines provide a "squeezing" action rather than an impact.



**Key Features:**
- Full load available at any point in the stroke.
- Adjustable ram speed.
- Overload protection (pressure relief).

## 4.3 Speed and Stroke Behavior
The following table compares the performance of different forging technologies:

| Forging Machine | Speed Range (m/s) | Speed-Stroke Behavior |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Hydraulic Press** | 0.06 - 0.30 |  |
| **Mechanical Press** | 0.06 - 1.5 |  |
| **Screw Press** | 0.6 - 1.2 |  |
| **Gravity Drop Hammer** | 3.6 - 4.8 |  |
| **Power Drop Hammer** | 3.0 - 9.0 |  |
| **Counterblow Hammer** | 4.5 - 9.0 |  |
